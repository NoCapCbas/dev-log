# DevLog


A coding log by Damon Diaz discipulus is a coding log documenting my attempt of learning various programming languages, tackling new technologies, and solving real-world problems with code.
Features:

- Write your blogs in markdown, which automatically transform into blog posts
- Uses Go's Gin web framework to serve content
- HTMX templating
- Mobile responsive
- No databases required
- Ready for you to start publishing, all you have to do is start writing your own markdown files in the markdown folder

Instructions for use:

- Start editing the files in /markdown to see how you can customise your blog posts
- Add your own colours and themes to the CSS file
